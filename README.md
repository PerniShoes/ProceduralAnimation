# Procedural Animation
Procedural animation of a snake.  
Some chunks of code are poorly designed.   
Decided to finish it "as is" and just apply learnt patterns in my next project.  
Overall it works pretty well, not exactly as I originally planned for it, but it's okay.  

Learnt about various algorithms, good and bad usage of smart pointers (weak, shared), about Manager class pattern, Observer pattern.
